## Project 1 (BingoBingo!)
#### by Yik Hung


### Overview
This game is mainly for children aged 6-10 to learn. There are no special requirements for the physical site, only a computer, and network. 
It can be used at home, in the library, or the classroom.This game is designed based on Jeopardy's inspiration. 
I found that Jeopardy's design is very good, which can greatly improve children's interest in learning. 
So I collected some topics that children like, made question cards and answer cards, and then guided the children to choose the topic which they are interested in learning.



### How it works
Once they choose the question, kids can either click the "I know the answer!" or "I don't know the answer" button.
Then the web page will show the answer" to the kids. Then go back to the main table and mark the previous question (which already chose) down. 
If kids finished all the questions, they can reset the main table and play it again.
